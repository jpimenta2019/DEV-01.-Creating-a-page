Required tags Include ALL tags from Chapters 01-03.  Use the Code Samples from your book as your checklist &amp; guide: http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (Heads up, your first Project is a Web Dev Portfolio, so consider this a nice code example page - like the textbook - that shows off all the basic html structures) Google “Lorem Ipsum,” read about it (spoiler: its dummy text to fill space) and generate some for your page’s content.  Label each section, for example, if you are demonstrating using bold, italics, superscript, etc., include a heading that explains so.  Instructions Using a text editor (i.e., Notepad++), create an html page with the required tags.  (😎 This is just how it is. If you code using a light-background editor - Like notepad - other developers think less of you. Consider downloading a dark theme) Save the file as index.html Include your name in the &lt;h1> tag  Check out Cumbie’s page here: https://goo.gl/ScfvLR (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (notice I used a URL shortener service? 😎) From my page, view the source, take the image code and include it on your page.   (Hint: my code might help you figure out the next step to validate your code) Validate your page using https://validator.w3.org (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.  For each error, correct it and Google W3C Schools (https://www.w3schools.com (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) Pro Tip: W3C Schools search function on their page isn't very good. Its easier to just Google: 'doctype w3cschools' for example) Zip up the file. Test your submission: unzip it, does it still work?
